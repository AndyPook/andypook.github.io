      <description>Trainer, support and consultant on Cognos products, both Powerhouse and their desktop reporting and OLAP analysis suite. Many projects at large multi-nationals. While in the Business Development Group I created a “game” which embedded the products into a desktop app written in Delphi. This was played by by prospects to show the value of analytics in a business context.</description>
